# SF programs in differentiation - activity analysis of cancer splicing programs during developmental tissue differentiation

Workflow analyzing Cardoso-Moreira *et al.* through our approach to assess the activity of splicing factors in cancer splicing programs during developmental differentiation, from embryo to adult, of human tissues. 

Outputs in `results/sf_programs_in_differentiation/files` and `results/sf_programs_in_differentiation/figures`.

## Outline
- `differentiation.smk`: analyze cancer splicing factor programs throughout differentiation.
