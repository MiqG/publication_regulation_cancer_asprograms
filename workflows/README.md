1. Gene expression profiles are good enough to predict splicing factor activities with empirical SF-exon networks
    - perturbation datasets gene expression
    - network inference
        - ARACNe
        - MLR
        - Empirical
2. We screen which KO switch the cancer splicing programs
    - Replogle dataset
