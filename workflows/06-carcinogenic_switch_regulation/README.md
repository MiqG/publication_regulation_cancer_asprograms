# Carcinogenic Switch Regulation - Splicing factor activity analysis of Perturb-seq dataset to study the regulation of cancer splicing programs systematically

Workflows identifying potential genes and pathways regulating cancer splicing programs.

Outputs in `results/carcinogenic_switch_regulation/files` and `results/carcinogenic_switch_regulation/figures`.

## Outline
- `01-upstream_regulators.smk`: gene-level analysis and regulatory networks
    
- `02-activity_modeling.smk`: pathway-level analysis and validation of MYC using Urbanski *et al.*
